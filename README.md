## Overview

This repository contains my solution to the Kaggle Multilingual Language Identification Challenge. The challenge focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and aims to identify the language of a given text among South Africa's 11 official languages.

## Problem Statement

In a country as linguistically diverse as South Africa, effective language identification is crucial for communication systems. The task involves developing models capable of accurately recognizing the language of a text, contributing to better communication in multilingual environments.

## Evaluation

The competition is evaluated based on the [Mean F1-Score](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/MeanFScore). The F1 score, a combination of precision and recall, serves as the metric for assessing the accuracy of language identification models.

## Files

- **`.csv`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **`.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **`submission.csv`**: Submission files for evaluation on Kaggle.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mudimelidh/multilingual-language-identification.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd multilingual-language-identification`
3. Install dependencies:
4. Explore the Jupyter notebook in the directory for data analysis and model development.
5. Experiment with different NLP techniques and models to enhance language identification accuracy.
6. Submit your predictions in the specified format on Kaggle and evaluate your model against the Mean F1-Score.

## Submission

submissions follow the required format outlined in the Kaggle competition guidelines.
